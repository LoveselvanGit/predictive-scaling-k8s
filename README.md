# Enhancing Kubernetes Efficiency with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)

## :rocket: Overview

This project leverages **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)** to predict load in Kubernetes environments, enabling efficient horizontal scaling decisions. By analyzing historical monitoring data, the model aims to enhance resource allocation, minimize costs, and improve system responsiveness.

## :thinking: Problem Statement

Kubernetes dynamic scaling often faces challenges due to fluctuating loads and complex cloud environment interactions. Traditional scaling methods can lead to inefficiencies or performance issues. This project proposes using ANNs to automate resource allocation by predicting load and scaling needs.

## :floppy_disk: Dataset

This project utilizes the following datasets:

- **Training Data (TrainData.csv):** Includes aggregated metrics such as CPU load, packet reception rates, and pod count. It provides various traffic scenarios to train the ANN model.
- **Test Data:**
  - **Kubernetes Cluster Data (TestK8sData.csv):** Contains time-stamped data on CPU usage, packet reception rates, and pods, used for testing ANN model performance.
  - **JMeter Tool Data (TestJMeterData.csv):** Logs from HTTP requests generated by JMeter, used for performance testing under web traffic conditions.

## :gear: Methodology

### Data Preprocessing:
Data cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering are carried out to prepare the dataset for ANN model training. A new feature, `CPU_Pack_Ratio`, is created to capture the relationship between system load and network activity.

### Model Development:
The ANN model is developed using **AWS SageMaker**. The model is trained on the provided dataset, using 50 epochs to improve prediction accuracy. A comparison of ANN's performance with traditional Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscalers (HPA) is also performed.

### Evaluation Metrics:
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** 1.14
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 0.54
- **R-squared (R²):** 0.96

## :trophy: Results

The ANN model predicts the required number of pods with high accuracy, demonstrating its potential for efficient scaling in Kubernetes environments.

## :guardsman: Ethical Considerations

- **Data Privacy:** Sensitive information from Kubernetes environments must be handled securely.
- **Transparency:** ANN models are often opaque, so ensuring transparency in decision-making is crucial.
- **Over-reliance:** It's important to balance automation with human oversight to maintain operational control.
